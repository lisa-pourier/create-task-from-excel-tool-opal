/**
 * Defines the interface of a channel. The typical channel flow in a campaign run is as follows:
 * 1. Check if the channel is `ready` to use
 * 2. Dynamically determine the `target` (may be provided statically in `app.yml` instead)
 * 3. `publish` the content template (in the future, this will instead happen when the campaign is modified)
 * 4. `prepare` for the run (if the method is implemented)
 * 5. `deliver` the content to batches of recipients with substitutions
 *
 * Outside of the campaign run flow, a channel must also be able to `preview` a given piece of content for a batch
 * of recipients.
